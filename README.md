Image Analysis Tool
Overview
This is an image analysis tool developed using Qt framework. It utilizes the K-means algorithm to find the most relevant pixel values in an image and generates a vector portrait image based on that analysis. This project is still under development, and additional functionalities will be added in the future.

Features
K-means Algorithm: Utilizes the K-means clustering algorithm to analyze pixel values in the input image.
Vector Portrait Generation: Draws a vector portrait image based on the results of the K-means analysis.
Qt GUI: Provides a user-friendly graphical interface for users to interact with the tool.
Under Development: This project is actively being developed, and more features will be added over time.
Requirements
Qt framework 
C++ compiler (supporting C++11 or later)
